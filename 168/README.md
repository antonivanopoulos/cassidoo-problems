# Casidoo Issue 168 Problem

You have a character who jumps forward n number of units at a time, and an array representing the road in front of them (where 0 is a flat piece of road, and 1 is an obstacle). Return true or false if your character can jump to the end without hitting an obstacle in front of them.

Examples:
```
$ characterJump(3, [0,1,0,0,0,1,0])
$ true // no hits

$ characterJump(4, [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0]) $ false // hits obstacle at position 4
```
